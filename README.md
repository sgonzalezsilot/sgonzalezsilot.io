## [Project 1: Pneumonia Detection with Chest X-Ray Images](https://github.com/sgonzalezsilot/FinalProjectComputerVision): 
* Build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to detect pneumonia with chest x-ray images.
* Fine-Tuned Resnet50 (trained with Imagenet) to obtain 94.54% accuracy.
* We apply ImageDataGenerator to balance the classes.
* We used TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.
